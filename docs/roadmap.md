# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for `gemini4s`.

## High Priority

- **Code Execution**: Support for code execution in `Tool` to allow the model to run code.
- **File API**: Implement `media.upload` to support uploading files directly via `GeminiService`.

## Medium Priority

- **Batch Generation**: Support for `batchGenerateContent` endpoint.
- **Tuned Models**: Management APIs for creating, listing, and deleting tuned models.
- **Grounding**: Integration with Google Search for grounded responses (`googleSearchRetrieval`).

## Future Ideas
